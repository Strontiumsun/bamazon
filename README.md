## For the Shoppers:

### Run the bamazonCustomer.js file and get shopping!

![Start](https://github.com/Strontiumsun/bamazon/blob/master/images/customer_start.PNG "Customer Start")

At the start, you can see all the products currently for sale

![choice](https://github.com/Strontiumsun/bamazon/blob/master/images/customer_purchase.PNG "Customer Purchase")

You'll be asked to choose which product to buy. Enter the ID number of the product and the ammount you wish to purchase

![result](https://github.com/Strontiumsun/bamazon/blob/master/images/customer_result.PNG "Customer Result")

After purchasing, you'll see the updated list of products with the ammount of product you purchased subtracted from the quantity of said product in stock!

## For the Managers:

### Run the bamazonManager.js file and take control of the shopping list!

As the manager, you can choose from four options:
* View Products for Sale
* View Low Inventory
* Add to Inventory
* Add New Product

![view](https://github.com/Strontiumsun/bamazon/blob/master/images/manager_view.PNG "manager view")

Choosing to view the products will produce a table just like for the Customer

![low](https://github.com/Strontiumsun/bamazon/blob/master/images/manager_low.PNG "see low inventory")

Choosing to view low inventory will display any product whose quantity is less than five

![add](https://github.com/Strontiumsun/bamazon/blob/master/images/manager_addstock.PNG "add to inventory")

When you select add to inventory, you can pick any item and add any quantity to its inventory

![new](https://github.com/Strontiumsun/bamazon/blob/master/images/manager_new.PNG "adding a new product")

If you want to expand our catalog, feel free to add an item! Here, the manager has chosen to add the [Pilot Goggles](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Pilot_Goggles "Pilot Goggles on Inkipedia")

![new add](https://github.com/Strontiumsun/bamazon/blob/master/images/manager_newview.PNG "after adding a new product")

Once you've added a new product, it'll appear in the inventory! 

## Until next time...
